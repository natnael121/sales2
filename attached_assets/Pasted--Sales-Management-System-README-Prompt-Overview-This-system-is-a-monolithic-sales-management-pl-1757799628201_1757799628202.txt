Monolithic system: all-in-one, simple and centralized.

Multi-organization support: admins can create and manage separate organizations with their own users, leads, and analytics.

Every lead tells a story: full history, no data loss.

Clear workflows: calls → meetings → field visits → conversions.

Transparency & motivation: targets, commissions, rewards, and leaderboards keep users engaged.
